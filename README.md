# revery-fetch

### A Fetch-like API for Reason, usable in both JSOO and native apps

## Special Thanks

`revery-fetch` relies on some great OCaml technology:
- [lwt](https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt) by [Ocsigen](https://ocsigen.org/home/intro.html)
- [ocaml-cohttp](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp) and related projects by [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/)

In addition, the example app is thanks to @cnguy, who created the original [Hackernews Revery App](https://github.com/cnguy/revery/tree/hackernews/examples/Hackernews)
